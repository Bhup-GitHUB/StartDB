**An AI-Powered Adaptive Database Management System**

_Self-optimizing • Cloud-Native • Built from Scratch_

</div>

---

## 🧠 Overview

StartDB is a next-generation experimental database engine that learns from usage patterns and optimizes itself automatically. Unlike traditional databases that require manual tuning, StartDB uses AI to predict query patterns, manage indexes, and adapt to workload changes in real-time.

**Think of it as a database with a built-in DBA that works 24/7.**

### Why StartDB?

Modern applications generate dynamic workloads with constantly changing access patterns. Traditional databases require:

- ⏰ Manual index creation and maintenance
- 🔧 Human intervention for optimization
- 📊 Periodic performance analysis

StartDB automates this entire workflow through intelligent pattern recognition and predictive optimization.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏗️ Core Database Engine (Go)

- **Custom Storage Engine**: Built-from-scratch persistence layer with disk and in-memory support
- **ACID Transactions**: Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ensures data durability and crash recovery
- **Concurrent Operations**: Goroutine-based architecture for high-throughput parallel queries
- **Flexible Indexing**: B-Tree and hash-based indexes with dynamic creation/deletion
- **SQL-Like Query Language**: Familiar syntax with custom parser implementation

### 🤖 AI Optimization Layer (TypeScript)

- **Query Pattern Analysis**: Machine learning models identify frequent and slow queries
- **Predictive Indexing**: Automatically recommends and creates indexes based on access patterns
- **Adaptive Caching**: Dynamic cache policies that evolve with workload changes
- **Performance Prediction**: Forecasts query execution time and resource usage
- **Schema Recommendations**: Suggests data model optimizations based on usage

### ☁️ Cloud-Native Design

- **Containerized Architecture**: Docker-first design for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration Ready**: Kubernetes manifests for auto-scaling and high availability
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics export for Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- **Distributed Ready**: Foundation for multi-node clusters (future phase)

### 🚀 Aerospike-Inspired Performance

- **Hybrid Memory Architecture**: Combines RAM speed with SSD persistence for optimal performance
- **Automatic Sharding**: Intelligent data distribution across nodes for load balancing
- **Multi-Tiered Storage**: Flexible storage options (in-memory, hybrid-flash, all-flash)
- **Smart Client**: Automatic cluster awareness and traffic distribution
- **Real-time Notifications**: Event streaming for data changes and system events

```

#### 3. Basic Usage

**Memory Storage (Default):**

```bash
startdb set user:1 "John Doe"
startdb get user:1
startdb list
```

**Disk Storage (Persistent):**

```bash
startdb --storage=disk set user:1 "John Doe"
startdb --storage=disk get user:1
startdb --storage=disk list
```

**Custom Data File:**

```bash
startdb --storage=disk --data=my_database.json set key:1 "Custom file"
startdb --storage=disk --data=my_database.json get key:1
```

### Available Commands

- `set <key> <value>` - Store a key-value pair
